  Provides tools for performing Transition Network Analysis (TNA) to study
  relational dynamics, including functions for building and plotting TNA models,
  calculating centrality measures, and identifying dominant events and patterns.
  TNA statistical techniques (e.g., bootstrapping and permutation tests) ensure
  the reliability of observed insights and confirm that identified dynamics are
  meaningful. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3706468.3706513"
