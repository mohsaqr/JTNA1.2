  Provides tools for performing Transition Network Analysis (TNA) to

  study relational dynamics, including functions for building and plotting TNA

  models, calculating centrality measures, and identifying dominant events and

  patterns. TNA statistical techniques (e.g., bootstrapping and permutation

  tests) ensure the reliability of observed insights and confirm that

  identified dynamics are meaningful. <a
